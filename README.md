# TerrariaGen

TerrariaGen is an optimized version of Terraria World Generation rewritten in C++. This project aims to provide a faster, easy-to-read, and fully compatible alternative to the vanilla Terraria World Generation. The basics of the generation process have been completed and will be published after final cleaning and refinement.

**Note to Re-Logic:**
I had an enjoyable time working on this project. My goal was to see how fast Terraria World Generation could be made through optimization and to share these findings with the community for educational purposes as well as speedrunning purposes. I respect the effort and creativity that goes into developing and maintaining Terraria. If there are any concerns or issues, please feel free to reach out to me at `cactusduper1@gmail.com`, and I will promptly address them.
